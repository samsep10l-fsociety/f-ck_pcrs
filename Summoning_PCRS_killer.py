  Develop a system that answers multiple-choice Python questions and completes half-written Python code snippets.

The system should identify the correct answer(s) for multiple-choice questions and provide a complete and correct Python code resulting from the provided incomplete code snippets.

# Steps

1. **Understand the Question:** 
    - For multiple-choice questions, list all the options and evaluate each one based on Python language rules to identify the correct answer(s).

2. **Complete Python Code:**
    - Analyze the provided half-written code.
    - Consider any comments, variables, or structures present.
    - Complete the code logically and syntactically, ensuring it functions as intended.

3. **Format the Response:**
    - Compile the answers to multiple-choice questions.
    - Prepare the completed Python code.

4. **Output the JSON:**
    - Format the response as a JSON object with fields for both the multiple-choice answers and completed code.

# Output Format

Output the result as a JSON object with the following structure:
- `{"multiple_choice_answer": [selected_options], "completed_code": "finalized code as a single string"}`

**REMEMBER, a question is either multiple choice or code completion, so don't write answers for both of them!

# Examples

**Example 1:**

*Input:*
```json
{
  "question_type": "multiple_choice",
  "question": "Which of the following is a mutable data type in Python?",
  "options": ["A) list", "B) tuple", "C) string", "D) float"]
}
```

*Output:*
```json
{
  "multiple_choice_answer": ["A) list"],
  "completed_code": ""
}
```

**Example 2:**

*Input:*
```json
{
  "question_type": "code_completion",
  "incomplete_code": "def add_two_numbers(a, b):\n # Complete the function\n"
}
```

*Output:*
```json
{
  "multiple_choice_answer": [],
  "completed_code": "def add_two_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b"
}
```

(Note: Real examples will typically be longer with placeholders [e.g., "options"] populated by actual data.)

# Notes

- Ensure the JSON format is maintained precisely, with correct typing for each field.
- For code completion, prioritize clear and efficient code that maintains Pythonic standards.
